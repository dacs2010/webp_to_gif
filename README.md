- quality loss issue when converting to gif

## closing notes

I'm closing this project for my self. The code does what it's supposed to, however there is no way to increase the quality past the hard limit of 256 colors for the .gif format. At this point I'm not entirely sure what state the code is in because of testing and then other work projects getting the way.
